# Template-PythonWeek6
Repository template for Week 6 assignment on Python: If and While

## Assignment:
Create one Python file homework6_<firstname_lastname>.py and perform the following exercises:
### Conditional Lists:
Perform the following tasks to mimic how a website ensures everyone has a unique username.
1.	Create a list named web_users that contains five or more user names.  
2.	Create a second list with another five user names called new_users.  Ensure that two user names in new_users also exist in web_users, but the other three do not.
3.	Create a loop to check if each user name in new_users has already been used in web_users. If the user name exists in both lists, print the message:
This user name is already in use. Please choose a different user name.
If the user name does not already exist, print the message:
This user name is available.

### Nested Dictionaries:
1.	Create a new dictionary called cities.  Plan to use three distinct city names as keys in your dictionary.
2.	For each city, create a dictionary that includes:
a.	The key country that specifies the country the city is in.
b.	The key population that includes the approximate population as an integer.
c.	The key fact that specifies one fact about the city.
3.	Add each of these cities to the original dictionary cities.
4.	Print the information in the following format:

City: <Name>
	Country: <Name>
	Population: <Count>
	Fact: <A fact about the city.>
City: <Name>
	Country: <Name>
	Population: <Count>
	Fact: <A fact about the city.>
City: <Name>
	Country: <Name>
	Population: <Count>
	Fact: <A fact about the city.>
